# Trackota Data Fixtures

This folder is for Toyota GR Cup dataset files used by the backend service.

Expected files (placeholders OK for now):
- race_telemetry.csv
- pit_stops.csv
- lap_times.csv
- sector_analysis.csv
- vehicle_info.csv

Notes:
- Vehicle ID format: GR86-004-78 (chassis 004, car 78)
- Lap counts may have erroneous values (e.g. 32768)
- Sections correspond to track divisions; each has subsections a and b

Do not commit licensed or proprietary data to the repository. Provide a minimal sample or mock for local development.
